        <h3>About Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p>Breast cancer originates from abnormal cell growth in breast tissue. While it is most frequently diagnosed in women in the United States (following skin cancer), it can affect anyone. Since everyone has some breast tissue, the risk applies universally.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, breast cancer survival rates have improved, and mortality rates are declining. This progress is largely attributed to widespread support for breast cancer awareness and research funding.</p>

        <p>Advancements in breast cancer screening enable earlier diagnosis, increasing the likelihood of successful treatment. Even when a cure isn’t possible, various treatments can extend life. Ongoing research aids healthcare professionals in selecting the most effective treatment strategies.</p>

        <h3>Risk factors of Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p><b>Being female.</b> Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer.</p>
        <p><b>A family history of breast cancer.</b> Having a family history of breast cancer, especially if it involves parents, siblings, or children, increases your risk of developing the disease. The risk is even higher if your family members were diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age or if multiple family members have been affected. However, it’s important to note that most people diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease.</p>
        <p><b>Obesity.</b> People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>There are many other factors like; age, pregnncy history, acohol drinking, radiation exposure...</p>

    <h3>Symptoms of Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p>A breast lump or thickened area of skin that feels different from the surrounding tissue.</p>
        <p>A nipple that looks flattened or turns inward.</p>
<p>Changes in the color of the breast skin. In individuals with fair skin, the skin of the breasts might appear pink or red. For those with brown or Black skin, the breast skin can appear darker than the surrounding skin on the chest, or it may exhibit shades of red or purple.</p>
    <p>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast.</p>
<p>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as skin that appears dimpled or resembles an orange peel.</p>

    <h3>Ways To Prevent Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p><b>Ask about breast cancer screening.</b> Discuss with your doctor or another healthcare professional regarding the appropriate timing to initiate breast cancer screening. Inquire about the advantages and potential risks associated with screening. By collaborating, you can determine which breast cancer screening tests are most suitable for your individual needs.</p>
        <p><b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> If your weight is healthy, strive to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, consult a healthcare professional regarding healthy methods to achieve weight loss. Consider reducing calorie intake and gradually increasing exercise to achieve your goals</p>
        <p><b>Exercise most days of the week.</b> Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly.</p>
        <p>There are other prevention methods for breast cancer like; drinking less alcohol(if at all), limiting menopausal hormone therapy...</p>

    <h3>Statistics on Breast Cancer</h3>
    <p>Breast cancer is a significant health challenge, but there are positive aspects to consider that can offer hope and encouragement. Here are some uplifting statistics and information from 2023 that may boost the self-esteem of those affected by breast cancer:</p>
<br>
<p><b>High Chances of Overcoming Breast Cancer.</b> A significant majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer are likely to live beyond five years, especially with early-stage diagnoses. Specifically, nearly all women with stage 1, 90% with stage 2, and over 70% with stage 3 breast cancer can expect to survive the condition.</p>
        
<p><b>Worldwide Recognition and Support.</b> Awareness and understanding of breast cancer have grown globally, resulting in enhanced research funding, better treatment options, and a robust support network for those affected.</p>
        
<p><b>Progressive Treatment Developments.</b> The field of breast cancer treatment is witnessing ongoing progress, with innovative treatments and tailored medical strategies enhancing patient care.</p>
        
<p>It's important to remember that each person's journey with breast cancer is unique, and these statistics represent general trends. Just because you knew someone who didn't have a good encounter with breast cancer, doesn't mean yours will be the same. Keep up.</p>
